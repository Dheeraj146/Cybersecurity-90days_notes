# Network Security Monitoring with Snort

Welcome to the Network Security Monitoring project! In this guide, we'll explore how to set up and configure Snort, a powerful open-source Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that helps protect your network by monitoring traffic and detecting suspicious activities.

## üìã Prerequisites

Before we dive in, make sure you have the following:

- **Snort**: The latest version can be downloaded from [Snort's official website](https://www.snort.org/downloads).
- **Libdnet**: Install it using the following command on Ubuntu/Debian:

  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install libdnet-dev
  ```

## üöÄ Installation

1. **Download Snort**

   Get the latest Snort release from the [official Snort website](https://www.snort.org/downloads).

2. **Extract the Archive**

   Unzip the downloaded file and navigate into the extracted directory.

3. **Install Snort**

   Run the following commands to install Snort:

   ```bash
   ./configure --enable-sourcefire
   make
   sudo make install
   ```

4. **Verify Installation**

   Confirm that Snort is installed correctly:

   ```bash
   snort -V
   ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

1. **Create Configuration File**

   Create a configuration file named `snort.conf` in the `/etc/snort` directory. Use the following configuration:

   ```plaintext
   # Set the network interface to monitor
   var RULE_PATH /etc/snort/rules
   var SO_RULE_PATH /etc/snort/so_rules
   var PREPROC_RULE_PATH /etc/snort/preproc_rules
   var WHITE_LIST_PATH /etc/snort/rules
   var BLACK_LIST_PATH /etc/snort/rules

   # Configure the output plugins
   output alert_fast: filename snort.alert
   output log_tcpdump: filename snort.log

   # Include the default Snort rules
   include $RULE_PATH/snort.rules
   include $RULE_PATH/local.rules

   # Include the community rules
   include $RULE_PATH/community.rules
   ```

2. **Set Up Directories**

   Create the necessary directories:

   ```bash
   sudo mkdir -p /etc/snort/rules
   sudo mkdir -p /etc/snort/preproc_rules
   sudo mkdir -p /etc/snort/so_rules
   ```

3. **Download and Extract Default Rules**

   Fetch the default Snort rules:

   ```bash
   sudo wget -P /etc/snort/rules https://www.snort.org/rules/snortrules-snapshot-2976.tar.gz
   ```

   Extract the rules:

   ```bash
   sudo tar -xvzf /etc/snort/rules/snortrules-snapshot-2976.tar.gz -C /etc/snort/rules
   ```

4. **Add Custom Rules**

   Create a file named `local.rules` in the `/etc/snort/rules` directory. You can add custom rules here to monitor specific traffic patterns.

## üö¶ Usage

To start Snort, use the following command:

```bash
sudo snort -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -i <interface>
```

Replace `<interface>` with the network interface you wish to monitor.

## üõ†Ô∏è Explanation

Snort is a versatile IDS that helps safeguard your network by analyzing traffic for signs of malicious activity. It operates based on a set of rules, configured in the `snort.conf` file. The default rules cover a broad range of potential threats, while the `local.rules` file allows you to tailor the monitoring to your specific needs.

**Key Points:**

- **Traffic Monitoring:** Snort inspects network packets to identify potential threats.
- **Real-Time Alerts:** It generates alerts for suspicious activity.
- **Integration:** Snort can be integrated with other security tools for enhanced protection.

## üîî Note

This guide provides a basic setup for Snort. For a more robust security solution, consider adding more rules and customizing your configuration. Remember to run Snort with the necessary permissions and in a suitable environment.
